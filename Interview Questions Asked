Ques. How @Transactional works in Spring? 
Ans. Without @Transactional we need to write-
UserTransaction utx = entityManager.getTransaction(); 

try { 
    utx.begin(); 
    businessLogic();
    utx.commit(); 
} catch(Exception ex) { 
    utx.rollback(); 
    throw ex; 
}

Problem of above code,
i)it's repetitive and error prone
ii)any error can have a very high impact
iii)errors are hard to debug and reproduce
iv)this decreases the readability of the code base

With @Transactional,
@Transactional
public void businessLogic() {  ...}

By using @Transactional, many important aspects such as transaction propagation are handled automatically. In this case if another transactional method is called by 
businessLogic(), that method will have the option of joining the ongoing transaction.

Transaction propogation levels-
